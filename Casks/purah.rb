  app "Purah.app"

  # Homebrew quarantines cask downloads on purpose so Gatekeeper can judge them.
  # Purah is self-signed rather than notarized, so that verdict is always
  # "cannot be opened" — the flag is cleared here, which leaves the app in the
  # same state as one built on this machine. Delete this block the day a
  # Developer ID certificate signs a release.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Purah is self-signed, not notarized by Apple, and this tap clears the
    download quarantines Homebrew applies for that reason. The DMG from
    https://github.com/rheatin/Purah/releases/latest goes through Gatekeeper
    as usual if you would rather approve it yourself.
